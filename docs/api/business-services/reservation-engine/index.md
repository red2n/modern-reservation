    participant G as Guest
    participant RE as Reservation Engine
    participant AC as Availability Calculator
    participant RM as Rate Management
    participant PP as Payment Processor
    participant AE as Analytics Engine

    G->>RE: Create Reservation Request
    RE->>AC: Check Availability
    AC-->>RE: Availability Confirmed
    RE->>RM: Get Current Rates
    RM-->>RE: Rate Information
    RE->>PP: Process Payment
    PP-->>RE: Payment Confirmed
    RE->>AE: Log Reservation Event
    RE-->>G: Reservation Confirmed
```

- **CONFIRMED** - Payment processed, booking confirmed
- **CHECKED_IN** - Guest has arrived
- **CHECKED_OUT** - Guest has departed

## üîÑ Event-Driven Architecture

### Kafka Integration
The Reservation Engine participates in the event-driven architecture:

```yaml
# Kafka Topics (Planned)
topics:
  consume:
    - availability-updates
    - rate-adjustments  
    - payment-events
    
  produce:
    - reservation-events
    - guest-events
    - inventory-holds
```

### Event Schemas
```json
{
  "reservation.created": {
    "reservationId": "string",
    "propertyId": "string", 
    "guestId": "string",
    "checkInDate": "date",
    "checkOutDate": "date",
    "roomType": "string",
    "totalAmount": "decimal",
    "status": "string"
  }
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Local Development Setup
```bash
# Start the service (when implemented)
./dev.sh start reservation-engine

# Run with development profile
cd apps/backend/java-services/business-services/reservation-engine
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev
```

### Testing
```bash
# Unit tests
mvn test

# Integration tests with dependencies
mvn verify -P integration-tests

# End-to-end booking flow tests
mvn verify -P e2e-tests
```
