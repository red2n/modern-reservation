# GitHub Workflows

This directory contains GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD automation.

## Available Workflows

### 1. Build Java Services (`build-java-services.yml`)

**Purpose:** Build and test all Java microservices

**Type:** ‚ö° Automatic (on push/PR)

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` or `develop` branches (when Java files change)
- Pull requests to `main` or `develop` branches
- Manual trigger via workflow dispatch

**What it does:**
1. ‚úÖ Sets up JDK 17 (Temurin distribution)
2. ‚úÖ Caches Maven dependencies for faster builds
3. ‚úÖ Builds shared backend utilities
4. ‚úÖ Builds infrastructure services:
   - Config Server
   - Eureka Server
   - Gateway Service
5. ‚úÖ Builds business services:
   - Reservation Engine
   - Payment Processor
   - Rate Management
   - Availability Calculator
   - Analytics Engine
   - Batch Processor (if implemented)
6. ‚úÖ Runs unit tests for all services
7. ‚úÖ Generates build summary report
8. ‚úÖ Uploads JAR artifacts (7 days retention)
9. ‚úÖ Uploads test reports (7 days retention)

**Build Matrix:**
- Java Version: 17
- OS: Ubuntu Latest

**Artifacts:**
- `java-services-jars-{sha}`: All compiled JAR files
- `test-reports-{sha}`: All test execution reports

**Cache Strategy:**
- Maven local repository cached based on `pom.xml` changes
- Speeds up subsequent builds significantly

## Manual Trigger

You can manually trigger the workflow from GitHub Actions tab:

1. Go to Actions ‚Üí Build Java Services
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Select branch
4. Click "Run workflow" button

## Viewing Results

### Build Summary
Check the workflow summary for quick status of each service:
- ‚úÖ Green checkmark: Build succeeded
- ‚ùå Red X: Build failed

### Artifacts
Download compiled JARs or test reports from the workflow run page.

### Logs
View detailed logs for each build step to troubleshoot issues.

## Build Order (IMPORTANT!)

The workflow builds in this specific order:

1. **Parent POM** (`mvn install -N`) - Must be first!
2. **Backend Utils** - Shared utilities
3. **Infrastructure Services** - Config, Eureka, Gateway
4. **Business Services** - Domain services

**Why this order?** Child modules depend on the parent POM being in the local Maven repository first. The `-N` flag installs only the parent without recursively building children.

## Local Development

To replicate the CI build locally:

```bash
# Use dev.sh script (recommended)
./dev.sh start

# Or manually build all services
cd apps/backend/java-services

# Build infrastructure
cd infrastructure
for service in config-server eureka-server gateway-service; do
  cd $service && mvn clean package && cd ..
done

# Build business services
cd ../business-services
for service in reservation-engine payment-processor rate-management; do
  cd $service && mvn clean package && cd ..
done
```

## Adding New Services

When adding a new Java service:

1. Add the service directory to `apps/backend/java-services/`
2. The workflow will automatically detect and build it
3. No workflow changes needed (auto-discovery)

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures

**Maven dependency issues:**
- Check if `libs/shared/backend-utils` builds successfully
- Verify all dependencies are in Maven Central or configured repositories

**Out of memory errors:**
- Maven build uses default JVM settings
- Large services may need increased heap size in `pom.xml`

**Test failures:**
- Tests run with `-DskipTests` by default for faster builds
- Full test suite runs separately in test step
- Check test reports artifact for details

## Environment Variables

No environment variables required for basic builds.

For production deployments, you may need:
- `MAVEN_OPTS`: JVM options for Maven
- `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE`: Spring Boot profile

## Cache Management

Maven cache is automatically managed:
- Cache key: `${{ runner.os }}-maven-${{ hashFiles('**/pom.xml') }}`
- Updates when any `pom.xml` file changes
- Restore keys fall back to latest cache

To clear cache:
1. Go to repository Settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Caches
2. Delete relevant cache entries

## Performance

Typical build times (without cache):
- First build: ~10-15 minutes
- Subsequent builds (with cache): ~3-5 minutes

Services built in parallel where possible.

### 2. Deploy GitHub Pages (`deploy-pages-adhoc.yml`)

**Purpose:** Deploy documentation and reports to GitHub Pages

**Type:** üéØ Ad-hoc (manual trigger only)

**Why Ad-hoc?**
- Prevents unnecessary deploys on every commit
- Gives you full control over when to publish
- Reduces Actions minutes usage
- Documentation changes less frequently than code

**Triggers:**
- ‚úÖ Manual only via workflow dispatch
- ‚ùå Never automatic

**Manual Trigger Options:**

Go to Actions ‚Üí Deploy GitHub Pages ‚Üí Run workflow

You can choose:
- **Environment**: `production` or `staging`
- **Deploy API Docs**: Include GraphQL schemas (default: true)
- **Deploy Architecture**: Include diagrams and ADRs (default: true)
- **Deploy Reports**: Include test/coverage reports (default: false)

**What it deploys:**
1. üè† Beautiful landing page with navigation
2. üìö Project documentation from `/docs`
3. üîå API documentation (GraphQL schemas)
4. üèóÔ∏è Architecture diagrams and ADRs
5. üìä Test reports (optional)

**Deployment URL:**
- Will be shown in workflow output
- Typically: `https://{username}.github.io/{repo-name}`

**First-time Setup:**
1. Go to repository Settings ‚Üí Pages
2. Source: Deploy from GitHub Actions
3. Run the workflow once to enable Pages

**When to Deploy:**
- After major documentation updates
- After completing new features (API docs)
- After sprint reviews (for stakeholders)
- Before demos or presentations
- When you want to share architecture decisions

**Quick Deploy Command:**
```bash
# Via GitHub CLI (if installed)
gh workflow run deploy-pages-adhoc.yml \
  -f environment=production \
  -f deploy_docs=true \
  -f deploy_architecture=true \
  -f deploy_reports=false
```

## Best Practices

1. ‚úÖ Always use `./dev.sh` for local operations
2. ‚úÖ Run `mvn clean install` before committing
3. ‚úÖ Keep `pom.xml` files up to date
4. ‚úÖ Write unit tests for new features
5. ‚úÖ Check workflow status before merging PRs
6. ‚úÖ Deploy Pages only when documentation changes
7. ‚úÖ Use ad-hoc workflows for non-critical deployments

## Security

- No secrets required for building
- Artifacts are private to repository
- 7-day retention minimizes storage costs
- Pages deployment uses GITHUB_TOKEN

## Support

For issues with workflows:
1. Check workflow logs for error details
2. Run local test: `./scripts/test-github-build.sh`
3. Read [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for common issues
4. Verify local build works: `./dev.sh start`
5. Check MCP server rules: Ask Copilot for guidance
6. For Pages issues: Check repository Settings ‚Üí Pages

## Common Issues

### "Could not find artifact java-services-parent:pom"
**Solution:** Parent POM must be installed first. This is now automatic in the workflow.
See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#1--could-not-find-artifact-java-services-parentpom) for details.

### "Unsupported class file major version"
**Solution:** Java version mismatch. Workflow uses Java 21 to match project requirements.
See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#2--unsupported-class-file-major-version) for details.
4. Review pom.xml dependencies
